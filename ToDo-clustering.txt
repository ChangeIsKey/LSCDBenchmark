- start new branch for clustering (discuss with Andres)
- dataloader, main.py, results[class] (discuss with Andres) 
- start with Spectral_clustering[sklearn]
- one complete example with clustering (getting data, distance model, mapping use pairs to distances, 
    cluster the distances [specify a format], then compare cluster to gold, store the results)
- include dwug sense annotation (format other than the other datasets) - we need code to load this dataset.
- discuss with Andres, Dominik's code in order to load dwug dataset.
- add more clustering algorithms
- correlation clustering, stochastic block models, chinese whispers, agglomerative clustering [DO it]
- how do we generally install third party packages which are not available from pip?
- pull external code as long as it's possible (correlation clustering possibly)
- check with Andres if he added to the main README of the project, the explanation of using anaconda in order to run all the project dependecies mainly graph_tool
