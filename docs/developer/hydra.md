# Hydra

Hydra is a Python framework that is available for free and can make it easier to create complex applications and conduct research. We use the Hydra system to create a hierarchical configuration for the LSCDBenchmark in order to run multiple jobs efficitly. You can find our basic setting for Hydra in `conf/config.yaml`.
